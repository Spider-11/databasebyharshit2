     <h3>DBMS</h3>

<p>
DBMS stands for Database Management System. Itâ€™s software that allows users to interact with a database. It enables users to create, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently. DBMS provides an interface for users to interact with the database without needing to know the internal workings of how data is stored or retrieved. It also ensures data integrity, security, and concurrency control. There are various types of DBMS, including relational, object-oriented, and NoSQL databases, each suited for different types of data and applications.

 <h3>SQL (Structured Query Language)</h3>
        <img src="https://distinguished-demorest-s1h3y.zipwp.link/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/images.png" alt="Structured Query Language" class="center">
    <p>
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to perform various operations such as querying data, inserting new records, updating existing records, and deleting records. SQL is essential for tasks like retrieving information from a database, modifying data, creating and modifying database schemas (tables, views, indexes, etc.), and managing user permissions.

Key features of SQL include:

Data Querying: SQL allows users to retrieve data from one or more database tables using SELECT statements, along with various filtering and sorting options.

Data Manipulation: SQL provides commands like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE to add, modify, and remove data from database tables.

Data Definition: SQL includes commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP to define, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, and views.

Data Control: SQL enables users to manage user permissions and access control through commands like GRANT and REVOKE.

 <h3>PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language)</h3>
        <img src="https://distinguished-demorest-s1h3y.zipwp.link/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/images-1.png" alt="Procedural Language/Structured Query Language" class="center"><p>
PL/SQL is an extension of SQL that adds procedural features to the language, allowing users to write procedural logic directly in the database. It combines the flexibility of SQL with the power of procedural programming constructs such as variables, loops, conditional statements, and exception handling. PL/SQL enables developers to create complex, multi-step database applications and business logic within the database itself, reducing network traffic and improving performance by executing operations closer to the data.

Key features of PL/SQL include:

Procedural Constructs: PL/SQL supports procedural programming constructs such as variables, loops, conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE), and exception handling (TRY-CATCH).

Modularity: PL/SQL enables developers to encapsulate code into reusable units called procedures, functions, and packages, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Database Interaction: PL/SQL allows direct interaction with the database by embedding SQL queries and DML statements within procedural code blocks, enabling complex data processing and manipulation.

Error Handling: PL/SQL provides robust error handling mechanisms, allowing developers to handle exceptions gracefully and maintain data integrity.</p>
